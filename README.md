If you're not sure what is causing your game to crash, you can take advantage of the Windows Event Viewer tool to keep a log on what is happening to your PC when the game crashes. This can be used for diagnostic purposes.

It is also worth running demo versions of games before installing the full version, just to ensure that the title will play correctly on your PC.

If your AAA games keep crashing, here are the main reasons why that may be happening


* Your computer's spec is too low
* You overclocked too high
* The game's settings are wrong
* Your graphic card requires too much power
* You need to upgrade your operating system
* You need to upgrade device drivers
* Your network isn't fast enough
* Digital Rights Management is causing problems
* Games are running in the wrong mode
* Your antivirus is crashing games
* Using a VPN is slowing online games to the point they crash
* You have too many browser tabs open
